A python bot for retrieving the number of players and map name on a cs2 community server.

Inspired by [@Shower](https://github.com/showerhandal)

If you want to run the bot locally or on a server host and are having problems msg me on discord or telegram.
Alternatively you can add the bot yourself using this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1222724707044950058&permissions=551903380544&scope=bot)<br />

Ideas to add:<br />
Players on the server<br />
Split players into CT & T<br />
Add a flag besides the name<br />
Lookup player to see their gameme profile & steam profile.<br />
Steam profile info, i.e. age of account, recent username changes, pfp, etc<br />
Server stats, when was peak player average this week, server uptime, most active player, most played map, etc<br />
