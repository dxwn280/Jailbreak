A python bot for retrieving the number of players and map name on a cs2 community server.

Inspired by [@Shower](https://github.com/showerhandal)

If you want to run the bot locally or on a server host and are having problems msg me on discord or telegram.
Alternatively you can add the bot yourself using this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1222724707044950058&permissions=551903380544&scope=bot)
